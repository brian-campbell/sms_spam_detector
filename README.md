## Overview


## Background
This challenge refactors code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Once the model is created and trained, a Gradio app is developed to host the application. This app enabling users to test text messages. The application provides feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance.

## Files
This repository contains four files:
*  gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb - this file is the final solution for the project. It is a Jupyter Notebook. It contains all the required code to solve for the challenge based on specified requirements.
*  gradio_sms_text_classification_orig.ipynb - this is the orginal file provided by the class. It is only here for reference purposes and is not part of the final solution.
*  sms_text_classification_solution.ipynb - this is the original file that contains the code for the SMS text classification solution that was refactored and included in the final solution file `gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb.` No changes were made to this file.
*  sms_text_classification_solution_orig.ipynb - this file is the same as `sms_text_classification_solution.ipynb.` It was added to the project when the repository was originally created. It serves no purpose and is an artifact that could be removed.

The directory `Resources` contains a file `SMSSpamCollection.csv` that is the data input for the Challenge.
